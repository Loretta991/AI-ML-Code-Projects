As we saw in the previous section, given simple, well-separated data, k-means finds suitable clustering results.\n","\n","For example, if we have simple blobs of data, the k-means algorithm can quickly label those clusters in a way that closely matches what we might do by eye:\n","\n","[ ]\n","# Generate some data\n","from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_blobs\n","X, y_true = make_blobs(n_samples=400, centers=4,\n","                       cluster_std=0.60, random_state=0)\n","X = X[:, ::-1] # flip axes for better plotting\n","[ ]\n","# Plot the data with K Means Labels\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","kmeans = KMeans(4, random_state=0)\n","labels = kmeans.fit(X).predict(X)\n","plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels, s=40, cmap='viridis');\n","\n","From an intuitive standpoint, we might expect that the clustering assignment for some points is more certain than others: for example, there appears to be a very slight overlap between the two middle clusters, such that we might not have complete confidence in the cluster assigment of points between them. Unfortunately, the k-means model has no intrinsic measure of probability or uncertainty of cluster assignments (although it may be possible to use a bootstrap approach to estimate this uncertainty). For this, we must think about generalizing the model.\n","\n","One way to think about the k-means model is that it places a circle (or, in higher dimensions, a hyper-sphere) at the center of each cluster, with a radius defined by the most distant point in the cluster. This radius acts as a hard cutoff for cluster assignment within the training set: any point outside this circle is not considered a member of the cluster. We can visualize this cluster model with the following function:\n","\n","[ ]\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\n","\n","def plot_kmeans(kmeans, X, n_clusters=4, rseed=0, ax=None):\n","    labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)\n","\n","    # plot the input data\n","    ax = ax or plt.gca()\n","    ax.axis('equal')\n","    ax.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels, s=40, cmap='viridis', zorder=2)\n","\n","    # plot the representation of the KMeans model\n","    centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_\n","    radii = [cdist(X[labels == i], [center]).max()\n","             for i, center in enumerate(centers)]\n","    for c, r in zip(centers, radii):\n","        ax.add_patch(plt.Circle(c, r, fc='#CCCCCC', lw=3, alpha=0.5, zorder=1))\n","[ ]\n","kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=0)\n","plot_kmeans(kmeans, X)\n","\n","An important observation for k-means is that these cluster models must be circular: k-means has no built-in way of accounting for oblong or elliptical clusters. So, for example, if we take the same data and transform it, the cluster assignments end up becoming muddled:\n","\n","[ ]\n","rng = np.random.RandomState(13)\n","X_stretched = np.dot(X, rng.randn(2, 2))\n","\n","kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=0)\n","plot_kmeans(kmeans, X_stretched)\n","\n","By eye, we recognize that these transformed clusters are non-circular, and thus circular clusters would be a poor fit. Nevertheless, k-means is not flexible enough to account for this, and tries to force-fit the data into four circular clusters. This results in a mixing of cluster assignments where the resulting circles overlap: see especially the bottom-right of this plot. One might imagine addressing this particular situation by preprocessing the data with PCA (see In Depth: Principal Component Analysis), but in practice there is no guarantee that such a global operation will circularize the individual data.\n","\n","These two disadvantages of k-means—its lack of flexibility in cluster shape and lack of probabilistic cluster assignment—mean that for many datasets (especially low-dimensional datasets) it may not perform as well as you might hope.\n","\n","You might imagine addressing these weaknesses by generalizing the k-means model: for example, you could measure uncertainty in cluster assignment by comparing the distances of each point to all cluster centers, rather than focusing on just the closest. You might also imagine allowing the cluster boundaries to be ellipses rather than circles, so as to account for non-circular clusters. It turns out these are two essential components of a different type of clustering model, Gaussian mixture models.\n","\n","Generalizing E–M: Gaussian Mixture Models\n","A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) attempts to find a mixture of multi-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions that best model any input dataset.

This hyperparameter controls the degrees of freedom in the shape of each cluster; it is essential to set this carefully for any given problem. The default is covariance_type=\"diag\", which means that the size of the cluster along each dimension can be set independently, with the resulting ellipse constrained to align with the axes. A slightly simpler and faster model is covariance_type=\"spherical\", which constrains the shape of the cluster such that all dimensions are equal. The resulting clustering will have similar characteristics to that of k-means, though it is not entirely equivalent. A more complicated and computationally expensive model (especially as the number of dimensions grows) is to use covariance_type=\"full\", which allows each cluster to be modeled as an ellipse with arbitrary orientation.\n","\n","We can see a visual representation of these three choices for a single cluster within the following figure:\n","\n","(Covariance Type) figure source in Appendix\n","\n","GMM as Density Estimation\n","Though GMM is often categorized as a clustering algorithm, fundamentally it is an algorithm for density estimation. That is to say, the result of a GMM fit to some data is technically not a clustering model, but a generative probabilistic model describing the distribution of the data.\n","\n","As an example, consider some data generated from Scikit-Learn's make_moons function, which we saw in In Depth: K-Means Clustering:\n","\n","[ ]\n","from sklearn.datasets import make_moons\n","Xmoon, ymoon = make_moons(200, noise=.05, random_state=0)\n","plt.scatter(Xmoon[:, 0], Xmoon[:, 1]);\n","\n","If we try to fit this with a two-component GMM viewed as a clustering model, the results are not particularly useful:\n","\n","[ ]\n","gmm2 = GMM(n_components=2, covariance_type='full', random_state=0)\n","plot_gmm(gmm2, Xmoon)\n","\n","But if we instead use many more components and ignore the cluster labels, we find a fit that is much closer to the input data:\n","\n","[ ]\n","gmm16 = GMM(n_components=16, covariance_type='full', random_state=0)\n","plot_gmm(gmm16, Xmoon, label=False)\n","\n","Here the mixture of 16 Gaussians serves not to find separated clusters of data, but rather to model the overall distribution of the input data. This is a generative model of the distribution, meaning that the GMM gives us the recipe to generate new random data distributed similarly to our input.

A generative model is inherently a probability distribution for the dataset, and so we can simply evaluate the likelihood of the data under the model, using cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. Another means of correcting for over-fitting is to adjust the model likelihoods using some analytic criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Scikit-Learn's GMM estimator actually includes built-in methods that compute both of these, and so it is very easy to operate on this approach.\n","\n","Let's look at the AIC and BIC as a function as the number of GMM components for our moon dataset:\n","\n","[ ]\n","n_components = np.arange(1, 21)\n","models = [GMM(n, covariance_type='full', random_state=0).fit(Xmoon)\n","          for n in n_components]\n","\n","plt.plot(n_components, [m.bic(Xmoon) for m in models], label='BIC')\n","plt.plot(n_components, [m.aic(Xmoon) for m in models], label='AIC')\n","plt.legend(loc='best')\n","plt.xlabel('n_components');\n","\n","The optimal number of clusters is the value that minimizes the AIC or BIC, depending on which approximation we wish to use. The AIC tells us that our choice of 16 components above was probably too many: around 8-12 components would have been a better choice. As is typical with this sort of problem, the BIC recommends a simpler model.\n","\n","Notice the important point: this choice of number of components measures how well GMM works as a density estimator, not how well it works as a clustering algorithm. I'd encourage you to think of GMM primarily as a density estimator, and use it for clustering only when warranted within simple datasets.\n","\n","Example: GMM for Generating New Data\n","We just saw a simple example of using GMM as a generative model of data in order to create new samples from the distribution defined by the input data.
